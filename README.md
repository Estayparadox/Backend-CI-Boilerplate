## Install

At the root of the project run
```
$> yarn install
```

## Commands

```
$> yarn prestart
```
Builds the content of the src/ folder and puts it in the build/ folder. When you issue the yarn start command, this script runs first before the start script.

```
$> yarn start
```
Serves the content of the build/ folder instead of the src/ folder we were serving previously. This is the script youâ€™ll use when serving the file in production. In fact, services like Heroku automatically run this script when you deploy.
You should see the message below

```
$> yarn startdev
```
Start the server during development of the app using babel-node to run the app instead of regular node.
The --exec flag forces babel-node to serve the src/ folder using node since the files in the build/ folder have been compiled to ES5.
